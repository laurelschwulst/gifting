      <p>Hi everyone,</p>
      <p>Welcome to our class newsletter. This is the first issue —</p>
      <p>
        We are the Spring 2025 class officially titled VIS 208. Graphic Design:
        Link, at Princeton University, taught by Laurel Schwulst (who is writing
        this introduction). But this semester, the theme for the class is
        “Gifting.” We are exploring websites & everyday digital tools as
        opportunities for generosity...
      </p>
      <p>
        In that line of thinking, we wondered: Can a newsletter feel like a
        gift? And what makes a good gift, anyway?
      </p>

        year. And share a little about creating calendars, spheres, etc.)

        During the first class, I showed some examples of what I mean by gifting
        websites, or using everyday digital tools as opportunitites for
        generosity. One concrete example was the website "<a
          href="https://you-are-laurel-right.neocities.org/"
          >You are Laurel, right?</a
        >" created for me on my birthday by my friend and fellow web designer
        <a
          href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/editor-and-ceo-min-guhong-on-introducing-your-company/"
          >Min Guhong</a
        >, based in Seoul.

        As a surprise after the first class, Ben created a version of this site
        for his mom on her birthday, February 4th. It's called, "<a
          href="https://moms-birthday.neocities.org/"
          >You are mom, right?</a
        >" It was exciting to see this, so I asked Ben a few questions about the
        site:
      </p>
      <b>Laurel: How did your mom respond to receiving the website?</b>

      <p>
        Ben: My mom was very excited to receive the surprise birthday website.
        She remarked that she was curious about the different paths she could
        navigate through and admitted to refreshing and re-trying different
        routes to see all the content. At first she thought that I had made the
        website with a third-party tool, and she was impressed to learn that I
        used HTML/CSS to create it. I think this helped her see the website as a
        more personal gift that was crafted by me for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>L: How specifically did you send it to her?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        B: I sent a link to her over text yesterday and told her to wait until
        tomorrow (her birthday) to open it. She said it was a good exercise of
        patience!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>L: What was the process of creating the site like?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        B: It was really enjoyable to build the website. I used the website (on
        neocities) your friend had made you as a template for the html/css, but
        I adapted the logic, presentation, style, and content. For the design, I
        pulled some boilerplate css templates and adapted them to show different
        colors and fonts. To get the photos I searched through my phone and
        asked my siblings to share any they had. I tried for a while to get
        audio playing of me singing happy birthday, but I couldn't get it to
        work without paying for a subscription to neocities.
